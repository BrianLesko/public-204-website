## Renovation
---

204 has modern rennovations and historic detail. The home has real the red oak wood flooring and beautiful wooden trimwork, in part due to the preservation efforts of the historic district that the home reside in. Yet, despite the age, the home is outfitted with central air, an updated kitchen, and two full bathrooms.

Take a look at these photos, taken by me in July of 2023.

Want to learn more about how and when the home was rennovated? Ask me about it. I rennovated the place while returning to Ohio State University to get my Masters degree. (Webpage coming soon).

## Location
---

204 is located here. 

[picture]

While 204 is not the closest to center of campus, the beauty of the tree lined street brings you out of the concrete jungle and into something that feels more like *Your* place. The short walk to north campus, is very bikeable and walkable. It took me about 10 minutes to walk to Scott traditions, 8 minutes to make it to the starbucks on high and lane, and about 20 mintues to the ohio union.

## Dedication
---

Yes, this is my only rental. Because of that, you wont find many people that care more about customer service and providing a good place to live. Campus rentals are dominated by big companies. 

Despite being a smaller operation, I have the capability to fix any issues that may arise thanks to having the proper connections and from having a healthy emergency fund and proper management plan.

For example, in 2024, there was a freak plumping incident and a part of the sewer drainage had to be dug up and replaced, not a cheap thing to do. Despite this happening on a holiday weekend, the issue was fixed in less than a week.
